title: "Chaos Engineering: Injecting failure for building resilience in systems."
abstract: In a distributed world we all depend on the distributed systems more than ever. As these systems become more complex, the failures are much harder to predict. Chaos Engineering introduces the injection of failures as a discipline for building confidence in the resilience capability of the systems.
