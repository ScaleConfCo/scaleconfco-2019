title: Practical Cryptography for Devops
abstract: "We use cryptography everyday in our tools, and sometimes it’s done so automatically that we don’t even know cryptography is being used. However many people doesn’t know the basic cryptography concepts being used, or when to choose one of them: hashing, signing, symmetric vs asymmetric encryption."
