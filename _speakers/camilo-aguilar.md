title: Life beyond the hype
abstract: "When confronted with a new software project, weâ€™re all faced with the same question: How do we deploy it? These days, we are constantly bombarded with options and often have little time to make informed and technically sound decisions. This talk will take you through my experience when faced with the same question at a highly regulated, Fortune 50 US bank, with 99.5% uptime requirements. We will go over technical and organizational constraints, the decision process, and the production rollout of the first distributed system running on containers at this bank. You will walk away understanding that tooling trends are not always the solution and that going back to first principles is often a more sensible approach."
